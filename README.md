# Horrible-VRC-Module

I made this module at 4 AM to BSOD someone who leaked my code, which they did end up falling for, so I decided to keep adding onto it. This module is not meant to be malicious necessarily, because the features aren't very harmful to someone thats somewhat experienced with computers.

## Currrent Features
 - Designed to run without admin permissions because the client this module gets loaded into doesn't run as admin.
 - BSOD

## Features Being Added
 - Switching Keyboard Layout to Dvorak.
 - Deleting the all files in the steam directory that can be deleted without admin perms.
 - Doing some stuff in registrys to make VRC permanently broken unless its fixed.
 - Deleting the following: All program shortcuts,  desktop files, and all files inside of the current user directory that can be deleted without admin perms. Along with that it should overwrite the files empty data so the files are harder to recover with most tools.
