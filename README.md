# Horrible-VRC-Module

This module is the result of testing ideas to prevent my modules from getting leaked. It's not meant to be malicious but causing a BSOD when your module is tampered with is kindof useful.

## Currrent Features
 - Designed to run without admin permissions because the client this module gets loaded into doesn't run as admin.
 - BSOD

## Features Being Added
 - At some point support for a permanent BSOD will be added(i.e automatically throwing a BSOD on windows startup.
